### 7. Site URL Configuration
**Line 181:** `(1,'siteurl','http://greenhouseculture.ie','yes')`
- The site URL is set to http://greenhouseculture.ie

## Conclusion
The database definitively shows that **Prefer Blog** (child theme of Prefer) was the active theme when this database was exported on July 4, 2025. There is no evidence in this database that Virtue was ever the active theme, though it is installed and has theme modification settings stored.

The discrepancy between the documentation stating Virtue was active and the database showing Prefer Blog suggests either:
1. The documentation was outdated
2. The theme was changed after the documentation was written
3. There may have been confusion between what was intended vs. what was actually active

### Important Note
The theme_switched options are empty, which means WordPress doesn't have a record of the previous theme. This could indicate the site has been using Prefer Blog for a long time, or the theme switching history was cleared at some point.
