## Immediate Action Plan

2. **Update WordPress core** to latest stable version
3. **Update all plugins** individually, testing after each
4. **Install security plugin** and run initial scan
5. **Review user accounts** and strengthen passwords
6. **Enable automatic updates** for security patches

## Risk Assessment
- **Current Risk Level**: üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Primary Risk**: Outdated WordPress core with known vulnerabilities
- **Secondary Risk**: Outdated plugins, especially User Role Editor
- **Timeline**: Updates should be completed within 24-48 hours

The site is currently vulnerable to multiple attack vectors and requires immediate security updates to prevent potential compromise.
